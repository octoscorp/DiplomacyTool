# Diplomacy Tool Repository

Welcome to the Diplomacy tool repository! This is a collection of tools that I hope will positively contribute to the experience of playing the board game [Diplomacy][1].

## Tools

### Adjudication Tool (in progress)

A prototype of the Adjudication Tool has been created which passes the basic test cases of the DATC, but fails on most of the remainder. This is currently awaiting refactoring and completion of the test cases.

### Diplomacy Adjudicator Test Cases (in progress)

A class which applies the [DATC][2] to adjudicators and creates an output explaining which test cases failed and how they differed from expected.

### Future extensions

It would be nice to see the following tools in some capacity:
- A map editor which allows generation of map data visually and with minimal user input required.
